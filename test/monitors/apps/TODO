- atomic wait/notify
- tables
- Wasm GC
- SIMD
- stack switching
- more loopy traces
- more coverage
- more interpreters

Key difference over unit/regression tests:
- only have to execute a couple of times
  - but maybe enough to trigger dynamic tierup
- ok to combine into one massive smoke test
- want to keep down the number of programs and therefore VM invocations
