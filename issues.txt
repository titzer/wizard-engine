Monitors + trace
--------------------------------
	All --trace-interpreter, memory, calls, etc output events in code in common nested call trace format
	   > func1
	     > func2A
	       call event
	       > func3
	         instr event
	         memory access event
	     > func2B
	--trace-interpreter accepts a function filter
	--break-at inserts breakpoints at given location(s) and drops into debugger
	--trace-at inserts tracepoints at given location(s)
	build general-purpose "what is this program doing" monitor
	CallsMonitor should report source-names of callees
	--trace-tables should report read/write/calls through tables
	TrapsMonitor shows state of program at trap points (default?)
	VirgilMonitor hooks into sections of Virgil-generated Wasm
	--trace-exception tracks try/throw/catch
	MallocMonitor tracks malloc/free behavior
           - tries to find memory leaks
	   - perf metrics: total usage, average usage, distribution of alloc sizes, free distance
	   - heatmap of allocation sites, memory ranges
	   - timeseries of memory consumption (bytes, objects)
	   - lifetime analysis (time between allocate and free)
	MemoryMonitor records/reports at multiple granularities
	   - read/write count
	   - strides (FFT somehow ?), use prefetching detector algorithms
	   - hotness / heatmap
	   - memory access density (accesses per 1000K instructions)
	   - aliasing relationship between "pointers" into memory
	   - how often contents of memory change
	   - inform heap order PGO for faster Virgil program startup
	CacheMonitor simulates and analyzes cache behavior
	BranchPredictMonitor simulates and analyzes branch predictor behavior
	DebugMonitor supports tab completion, uncooked terminal, etc
	PathsMonitor profiles program paths
	PhaseMonitor detects program phases
	ObjectMonitor tracks allocations and mutations for WasmGC objects
	-trace-calls, trace-globals, trace-tables show mutations
	-trace-memory should show what memory monitor does currently
	Global call stack depth tracking for monitor outputs
	       events: instructions, calls, exceptions
	Coverage monitor should have more useful default output
	{Instr,Block}TraceMonitor outputs compressed instruction/block traces for analysis
	ProfileMonitor:
		add a flat mode that is more efficient
		add profiling of compilation, runtime, gc, and host calls
	Hooks needed:
	  - wasm: traps, throw/catch, memory access, suspend/resume, host calls, frame unwind
	  - engine: gc, compile, load, verify
        LoopMonitor	track and display loop count distribution, improve display
	Interactive - show an interactive, terminal-animated view of execution, e.g. which function
		    func | xxx xx | <- color indicates how recent / hot
		    mem  | ====== |
	ConstMonitor - track const load/store, global get/set
	   - track whether a given store instruction>
	     - always stores to the same address
	   - track whether a given load instruction:
	     - always loads from the same address
	     - always loads the same value => partial eval
	     - always loads data that is not later modified by the program => partial eval
	   - track whether a given global.get:
	     - always loads the same value
	   - track whether a given global.set:
	     - always writes the same value
	FuncMemAccessMonitor - compute the set of accessed memory for each function
	   - Does a given function
	     - access a fixed number of unique locations (e.g. close to a param)
	       => lift loads and sink stores, make function pure
	     - access memory in linear strides
	     - access memory through chaining (taint)
	   - Can use dataflow analysis from arguments to determine input addresses
	DeadCodeEliminator
	   - uses results from coverage to insert UNREACHABLE into unreachable paths,
	     then feed to optimizer like Binaryen
	NanCanonicalizer
	   - probe all instructions that can produce NaN and replace result via
	     FrameAccessor with canonical nan (or 0, like denan from Binaryen)
	Taint
	   - propagate taint labels from certain calls through locals, memory, tables,
	     remove them through certain calls, and check they don't reach other calls.
	Memoizer
	   - detect statically-, dynamically-, and empirically-pure functions
	   - for functions that read mutable state, consider the values of recorded
	     mutable locations as part of the key for memoization
	Metadata
	   - estimate of metadata usage for the program, including size of module,
	     tables, functions, objects, stacks etc
	ProgressMonitor
	   - For a given execution of a program, determines where and what logic to
	     inject to report progress at regular intervals
	OpcodeMonitor
	   - whamm version that uses wizeng.get_opcode_name and opcode bound variable
